# Digital Twin Concept Prototype — Ede–Veldhuizen
This project was developed as part of the Academic Consultancy Training (ACT) course (Period 1, academic year 2025–2026) 
at Wageningen University & Research, as part of the project “Digital Twin for Blue Zone Development.”
The interactive Streamlit app represents a first version of a concept prototype for a Digital Twin for the 
Veldhuizen district in Ede, designed to support healthy aging.  
It visualises selected Quality of Life (QoL) indicators for residents aged 65+, allowing users to explore, 
compare, and reflect on social, physical, environmental, and psychological drivers.
For prerequisites, see 'runtime.txt' and 'requirements.txt'.  
To run the app locally, download the folder and run:

streamlit run Home.py

This prototype is a demonstration only.
It is not predictive and does not display real-time data.
